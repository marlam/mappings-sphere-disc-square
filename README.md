This is source code originally written for the paper

[M. Lambers, Mappings between sphere, disc, and square. In Journal of Computer Graphics Techniques (JCGT), 5(2), 2016, pages 1-21](http://jcgt.org/published/0005/02/01/)

All mapping methods between sphere, disc, and square are implemented
in the included libproj library. No external libraries are required.

The analysis methods are grouped into disk-square methods and sphere-map
methods. The pngvis and pdfplot modules require Qt.
